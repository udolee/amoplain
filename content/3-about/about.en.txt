Amoshop is a shop and curated gallery focusing on graphic design and visual culture founded in 2013. We have offered products and contents in collaboration with talented designers so far.

We are Amina and Felicia, the founders of Bartaile. We first met in college in 2002.

Although we hailed from different parts of the globe, we quickly discovered shared interests: a love for travel, an itch for bold experiences, and a boundless outlook. And a mild obsession with dim sum. After college we parted ways, living and working in three continents and twelve cities.

It wasnâ€™t until 2012 that we found ourselves geographically reunited while pursuing our MBAs at The Wharton School.
